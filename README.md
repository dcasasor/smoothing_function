# smoothening_function

This piece of code is based on the paper: "Direct methods for consistent initialization of DAE systems" by Vieira and Biscaia Jr (Computers and Chemical Engineering, 25, 1299-1311). The smoothening function proposed in that work (Equation 2) is plotted with python as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 therein.
